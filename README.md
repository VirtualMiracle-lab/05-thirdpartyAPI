# 01 PROJECT OPERATION

This project was a text to see how we would react to API's and jQuery. Creating variables and implementing them into a for loop to create a daily work scheduler. I had to link moment.js to be able to run the API so that my page would be dynamic with the time and date. 


## PROJECT USES
